# Project Description
PosFit is an AI based web application that targets home gym exercisers. Due to the time and site limitation, many exercisers start looking for a home gym option. With the convenient online shopping, equipment can be easily purchased via the internet. However, the knowledge about fitness must come from demonstrations. Therefore, exercisers watch tutorial videos and imitate the fitness activities.\
PosFit has one feature that none of our competitors have is providing free feedback. We deploy a deep learning model to track a user's joints, and provide feedback based on the user's body forms in comparison to the fitness instructor's in the video.
